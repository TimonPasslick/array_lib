# array_lib
for Arduino - makes working with arrays on the stack, on the heap and growing arrays on the heap more comfortable

Simplicity is my main design goal: This is just a small header file with one function and three small classes that will probably give you all the functionality you need, especially for small projects.

To see an example usage, check out test.ino. There are many comments in array_lib.h which serve as a documentation.
